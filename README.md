Welcome to Zappa!
Zappa is a system for running server-less Python web applications on AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway.
This `init` command will help you create and configure your new Zappa deployment.
Let's get started!
Your Zappa configuration can support multiple production stages, like 'dev', 'staging', and 'production'.
What do you want to call this environment (default 'dev'):
```
 Zappa asks you to define which env you want to configure, as it’s able to handle multiple envs. stick with the default ‘dev’.
